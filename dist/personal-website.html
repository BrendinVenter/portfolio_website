        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">About the Project</h3>
        <p>
          A couple of months ago I decided to finally dive headfirst into learning how to code and
          make the commitment to pursue a career in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology has always been my main passion, next to fitness and entrepreneurship, but for
          the last 8 years, I’ve spent my time pursuing goals in the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, after a bit of research on what type of projects I wanted to work on, I set out
          my study curriculum and got to work for the last 2 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period I’ve been learning all about HTML, CSS (Grid & Flexbox is pretty
          awesome!) and this wicked thing called Sass.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, watching can only get you so far so I decided that for my first portfolio
          project, I’d better build my self a personal portfolio website.
        </p>
        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">My Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          In order to keep things simple, the website needed to do meet four basic needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="portfolio-list-item">Host and showcase my future projects</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list-item">Showcase my current skills</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list-item">Give a brief insight into who I am</li>
          <li class="portfolio-list-item">
            Allow potential employers to view my resume and contact me
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Note: </strong>It did also need to look good! I’m no designer or artist but I do
          strongly believe that design matters and would help me potentially stand out more. And it
          was a great time to really work on and learn a lot of CSS in the process.
        </p>
        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">Features & Tech</h3>
        <p>
          The website uses a lot of what I’ve learnt so far when it comes to using HTML to structure
          my site and then CSS to create the various layouts with Grid and Flexbox and adding
          various design elements and effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also learnt a fair amount of Sass the last two months so I used it to build various
          common components and assign global variables that I’d commonly use like my fonts and
          colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also knew I wanted a couple of elements like a fixed nav, mobile overlay nav, smooth
          scroll, a typescript effect and a few subtle transition effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to get this to work, I needed to Google it and watch tutorials as I’ve only just
          started JavaScript so couldn’t do this on my own…yet.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Features & Tech</strong></p>

          <li class="portfolio-list-item">
            Google Fonts
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">What I Learnt</h3>
        <p>
          I learnt a TON! I’ve spent almost 40 hours on this project (a lot I know) and although
          there is a lot to improve, I am proud of how much I actually knew and could figure out
          using documentation and tutorials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also ran into a load of bugs and glitches when it came to the layout or design, and had
          to troubleshoot a lot to find a fix which can only be a good thing too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you get overwhelmed by how much there is to learn as a newcomer to the coding
          world but the more practice you get at solving similar issues you start to slowly piece
          the puzzle together and understand it more.
        </p>
        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">What I'd Improve</h3>
        <p>
          I have a lot of work to do when it comes to fully understand responsive design and which
          units and properties to use for the right task. I’m sure the way I’ve set up my grid and
          flexbox elements could be improved on too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I think the way the project is set up is a bit messy and perhaps not best practice
          and know that I could probably cut the amount of code down by at least half using proper
          nesting, custom properties and proper use of common classes etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue to improve and learn I’ll make sure to upgrade/fix the site.
        </p>

        <h3 class="portfolio-heading">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What a journey.</strong> Creating your first site without tools like WordPress and
          Squarespace from scratch was an experience I’ll never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a lot to work on and improve over the coming years for sure but what I learnt just
          from this project is priceless.
